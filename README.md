🎯 Objective

As a Data Scientist at Thera Bank, your role is to develop a classification model to:
- Identify customers at risk of leaving.
- Determine key factors contributing to churn.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

🔍 Approach

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns.
- Building and evaluating a machine learning classification model.
- Interpreting results to guide strategic improvements in bank services.

📊 Technology & Libraries Used

- Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-Learn
- Model Evaluation & Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV, SMOTE, StratifiedKFold

Project 3: Predicting Bank Customer Churn using Neural Networks 

📌 Overview

Customer churn is a significant challenge for financial institutions, leading to revenue loss and reduced customer lifetime value. This project aims to develop a neural network-based classification model to predict whether a customer will leave the bank within the next six months. By analyzing customer behavior and transaction patterns, the model helps banks implement proactive retention strategies.

🎯 Objective 

The goal of this project is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and build a deep learning model that accurately predicts potential churners. This insight enables banks to focus on service improvements and personalized customer engagement strategies to minimize attrition.

🔍 Approach 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized and analyzed customer behavior trends.
- Data Preprocessing: Scaled numerical data, handled missing values, and applied one-hot encoding.
- Model Development: Implemented a Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify churn likelihood.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance using RandomizedSearchCV.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessed accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores for model validation.
